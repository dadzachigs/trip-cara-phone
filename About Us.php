                <p><br>
              <strong>1-Residential areas are common grounds for children to  run spontaneously into the streets without looking for oncoming cars.</strong> </p>
              <p>Their  minds focus on retrieving their ball in the street or catching up to friends by  suddenly crossing roads on bikes, for instance. </p>
              <p>When driving through  residential streets, be wary of unpredictable objects and people in the  streets.</p>
                <p><br>
                  <img src="About Us_clip_image015.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="230" border="0"><br>
              <strong>2- Focus.</strong> Paying attention to the  traffic around you, frequently surveying your mirrors, and anticipating what  other drivers are going </p>
              <p>to do is the most important step to becoming a  courteous and safe driver.</p>
                <p><br>
                  <img src="About Us_clip_image017.jpg" alt="" width="328" height="246" border="0"><br>
              3- <strong>Use your turn signals, and use them at the right time.</strong> Notify other drivers of your intent to turn or to change lanes early enough  that</p>
                <p> they are able to take appropriate action. Sitting at a red light is NOT  the right time to turn on your blinker; if you had done so earlier, </p>
                <p>the person  behind you would have been able to change lanes and avoid sitting behind you  when the light turns green.</p>
                <p><br>
                  <img src="About Us_clip_image019.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="229" border="0"></p>
                <p><br>
                  4-<strong>If you are signaled to stop by the police, be nice to  the officer and they may let you go despite violating a traffic law.</strong> </p>
                <p>It  will depend on what you did and the traffic conditions as to the offense. Not  all officers are out to write tickets.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><img src="About Us_clip_image021.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="272" border="0"></p>
                <p><br>
              5- <strong>NEVER try to &quot;beat the light.</strong>&quot; If the  light turns yellow and you have enough space to stop safely, then stop.  Cyclists, pedestrians, </p>
                <p>and even other drivers expect you to be completely  stopped by the time the light turns red. You endanger yourself and others by  running </p>
                <p>yellow lights, only to save a minute or two, it simply isn't worth it.<strong></strong></p>
